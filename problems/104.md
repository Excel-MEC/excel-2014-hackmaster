   <p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:</p> Fn = Fn<img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />1 + Fn<img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. <p>It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.</p> <p>Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.</p>
