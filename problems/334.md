  <p>In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.<br />  Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.<br />  A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.<br /> The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.</p>    <p>For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:</p>    <img src="project/images/p_334_beans.gif" />    <p>You are given the following sequences:<br />                 t0 = 123456.                          ti =           <img src="project/images/p_334_cases.gif" />                                                        ti-1           2                                      ,                                   if ti-1 is even                                <img src="project/images/p_334_lfloor.gif" />                              ti-1           2                                      <img src="project/images/p_334_rfloor.gif" />                           926252,                            if ti-1 is odd                                                     where <img src='images/symbol_lfloor.gif' width='6' height='16' alt='&lfloor;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />x<img src='images/symbol_rfloor.gif' width='6' height='16' alt='&rfloor;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> is the floor function                                and <img src="project/images/p_334_oplus.gif" /> is the bitwise XOR operator.                          bi = ( ti mod 211) + 1.       </p>    <p>The first two terms of the last sequence are b1 = 289 and b2 = 145.<br />  If we start with b1 and b2 beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves would be required to finish the game.</p>    <p>Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b1, b2,..., b1500 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.</p>
