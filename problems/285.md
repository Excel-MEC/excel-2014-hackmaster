  <p>Albert chooses a positive integer k, then two real numbers a, b are randomly chosen in the interval [0,1] with uniform distribution.<br />  The square root of the sum (k&middot;a+1)2&thinsp;+&thinsp;(k&middot;b+1)2 is then computed and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to k, he scores k points; otherwise he scores nothing.</p>    <p>For example, if k&thinsp;=&thinsp;6, a&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.2 and b&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.85, then (k&middot;a+1)2&thinsp;+&thinsp;(k&middot;b+1)2&thinsp;=&thinsp;42.05.<br />  The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest integer, it becomes 6.<br />  This is equal to k, so he scores 6 points.</p>    <p>It can be shown that if he plays 10 turns with k&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, k&thinsp;=&thinsp;2, ..., k&thinsp;=&thinsp;10, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places, is 10.20914.</p>    <p>If he plays 105 turns with k&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, k&thinsp;=&thinsp;2, k&thinsp;=&thinsp;3, ..., k&thinsp;=&thinsp;105, what is the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places?</p>
