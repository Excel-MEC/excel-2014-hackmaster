  <p>Let H be the hyperbola defined by the equation 12x2 + 7xy - 12y2 = 625.</p>    <p>Next, define X as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that X is in H.</p>    <p>Now we define a sequence of points in H, {Pi : i <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1}, as:     P1 = (13, 61/4).   P2 = (-43/6, -4).   For i > 2, Pi is the unique point in H that is different from Pi-1 and such that line PiPi-1 is parallel to line Pi-2X. It can be shown that Pi is well-defined, and that its coordinates are always rational.    <img src=project/images/p422_hyperbola.gif>  </p>    <p>You are given that P3  = (-19/2, -229/24), P4 = (1267/144, -37/12) and P7 = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784).</p>    <p>Find Pn for n = 1114 in the following format:<br>If Pn = (a/b, c/d) where the fractions are in lowest terms and the denominators are positive, then the answer is (a + b + c + d) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.</p>    <p>For n = 7, the answer would have been: 806236837.</p>
