   <p>Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 &lt; 37 = 2187.</p> <p>However, confirming that 632382518061 <img src='images/symbol_gt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&gt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.</p> <p>Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.</p> <p class='info'>NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.</p>
