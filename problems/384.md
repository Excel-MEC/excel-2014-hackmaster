  <p>Define the sequence a(n) as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the binary expansion of n (possibly overlapping).  <br/>E.g.: a(5) = a(1012) = 0, a(6) = a(1102) = 1, a(7) = a(1112) = 2</p>    <p>Define the sequence b(n) = (-1)a(n).  <br/>This sequence is called the Rudin-Shapiro sequence.</p>  <p>Also consider the summatory sequence of b(n): <img src=project/images/p_384_formula.gif style="margin-top:-9px;">.</p>    <p>The first couple of values of these sequences are:  <br/>n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4 &nbsp &nbsp; 5 &nbsp &nbsp; 6 &nbsp &nbsp; 7  <br/>a(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2  <br/>b(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp;-1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp;-1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1  <br/>s(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4</p>    <p>The sequence s(n) has the remarkable property that all elements are positive and every positive integer k occurs exactly k times.</p>    <p>Define g(t,c), with 1 &le; c &le; t, as the index in s(n) for which t occurs for the c'th time in s(n).  <br/>E.g.: g(3,3) = 6, g(4,2) = 7 and g(54321,12345) = 1220847710.</p>    <p>Let F(n) be the fibonacci sequence defined by:  <br/>F(0)=F(1)=1 and  <br/>F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>1.</p>    <p>Define GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1)).</p>    <p>Find &Sigma;GF(t) for 2&le;t&le;45.</p>
