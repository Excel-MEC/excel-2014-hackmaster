  <p>The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are</p>    <p>    n123456789101112131415&hellip;  G(n)122334445556666&hellip;</p>    <p>You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.<br />  You are also given that &Sigma;G(n3) = 153506976 for 1 &le; n &lt; 103.</p>    <p>Find &Sigma;G(n3) for 1 &le; n &lt; 106.</p>
