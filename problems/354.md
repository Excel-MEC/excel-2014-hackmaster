  <p>Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.</p>      <img src="project/images/p_354_bee_honeycomb.png" />        <p>  One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.<br />  For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. <br />  For example, B(<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />3) = 6, B(<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.</p>    <p>Find the number of L &le; 5&middot;1011 such that B(L) = 450.</p>
