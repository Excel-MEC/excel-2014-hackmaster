  <p>Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon &ndash; or shape &ndash; whose vertices     vk (k&thinsp;=&thinsp;1,2,&hellip;,n) have coordinates:</p>                  xk&nbsp;&thinsp;&nbsp;= &thinsp;          cos( 2k-1/n &times;180&deg;&thinsp;)                yk&nbsp;&thinsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;          sin( 2k-1/n &times;180&deg;&thinsp;)          <p>Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior.</p>    <p>The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of     adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise:     (u,&thinsp;v) + (x,&thinsp;y) = (u+x,&thinsp;v+y).</p>    <p>For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:</p>      <img src="project/images/p_228.png" alt="picture showing S_3 + S_4" />    <p>How many sides does S1864&thinsp;+&thinsp;S1865&thinsp;+&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;+&thinsp;S1909 have?</p>
