  <p>Consider graphs built with the units A: <img src="project/images/p_194_GraphA.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="" />  and B: <img src="project/images/p_194_GraphB.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="" />, where the units are glued along  the vertical edges as in the graph <img src="project/images/p_194_Fig.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="" />.</p>    <p>A configuration of type (a,b,c) is a graph thus built of a units A and b units B, where the graph's vertices are coloured using up to c colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.<br />  The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,c) for all c <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 4.</p>    <p>Let N(a,b,c) be the number of configurations of type (a,b,c).<br />  For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.</p>    <p>Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).</p>
