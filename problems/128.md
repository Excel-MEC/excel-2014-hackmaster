   <p>A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles, starting at &quot;12 o'clock&quot; and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-clockwise direction.</p> <p>New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three rings.</p>  <img src='project/images/p_128.gif' width='400' height='431' alt='' />  <p>By finding the difference between tile n and each its six neighbours we shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.</p> <p>For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29, 11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.</p> <p>In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and 10, hence PD(17) = 2.</p> <p>It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.</p> <p>If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.</p> <p>Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.</p>
