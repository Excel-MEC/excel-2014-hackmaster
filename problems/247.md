  <p>Consider the region constrained by 1 &le; x and 0 &le; y &le; 1/x.  </p><p>  Let S1 be the largest square that can fit under the curve.<br />  Let S2 be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on. <br />  Let the index of Sn be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of squares to the left of Sn and the number of squares below Sn.  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_247_hypersquares.gif" alt="" />  <p>  The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number. <br />  S2 has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S2 is (1,0).<br />  It can be seen that the index of S32 is (1,1) as is the index of S50. <br />  50 is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (1,1).  </p>  <p>  What is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (3,3)?  </p>
