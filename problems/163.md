  <p>Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1 triangle in the sketch below.</p>  <img src='project/images/p_163.gif' width='300' height='200' alt='' />  <p>Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2 triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that size 2 triangle.</p>  <p>It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1 triangle building blocks.</p>  <p>If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size n, then</p>  <p style="margin-left:50px;">T(1) = 16<br />  T(2) = 104</p>  <p>Find T(36).</p>
