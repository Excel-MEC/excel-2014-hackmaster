  <p>  On the parabola y = x2/k, three points A(a, a2/k), B(b, b2/k) and C(c, c2/k) are chosen.  </p>  <p>  Let F(K, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (k, a, b, c) such that at least one angle of the triangle ABC is 45-degree, with 1 &le; k &le; K and -X &le; a &lt; b &lt; c &le; X.  </p>  <p>  For example, F(1, 10) = 41 and F(10, 100) = 12492.<br />  Find F(106, 109).  </p>
