  <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.<br />  Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.</p>    <p>Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, 100 = 3 + 8 + 89.<br />  Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of the number.</p>    <p>For any integer n>0, let z(n) be the number of terms in the Zeckendorf representation of n.<br />  Thus, z(5)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, z(14)&thinsp;=&thinsp;2, z(100)&thinsp;=&thinsp;3 etc.<br />  Also, for 0&lt;n&lt;106, &#8721;&thinsp;z(n)&thinsp;=&thinsp;7894453.</p>    <p>Find &#8721;&thinsp;z(n) for 0&lt;n&lt;1017.</p>
