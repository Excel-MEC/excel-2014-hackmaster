  <p>  The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.<br />  The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.<br />  We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.<br />  It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.  </p>  <p>  Let p be the product of the primes below 190.<br />  Find PSR(p) mod 1016.  </p>
