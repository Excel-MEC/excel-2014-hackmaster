  <p>A spherical triangle is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by three great circular arcs intersecting pairwise in three vertices.</p>    <img src="project/images/p_332_spherical.jpg" />      <p>Let C(r) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius r.<br />  Let Z(r) be the set of points on the surface of C(r) with integer coordinates.<br />  Let T(r) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(r).  Degenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great arc, are not included in T(r).<br />  Let A(r) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(r).</p>    <p>For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.</p>    <p>Find <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_332_sum.gif" /> A(r). Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.</p>
