  <p>Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:    A polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles)<br /> and the plinth (remaining tile);  the plinth has its centre at position (x&thinsp;=&thinsp;0, y&thinsp;=&thinsp;0);  the blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the unique lowest tile);  the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal to zero.  </p>    <p>When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:</p>  <img src="project/images/p_275_sculptures2.gif" />    <p>There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.<br />How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?</p>
