  <p>A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.<br />  Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:</p>      <img src="project/images/p_420_matrix.gif" />      <p>  We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.<br />  We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.  </p>    <p>  Find F(107).  </p>
