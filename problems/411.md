  <p>  Let n be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates (x, y) = (2i mod n, 3i mod n) for 0 &le; i &le; 2n. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the same station.  </p><p>  We wish to form a path from (0, 0) to (n, n) such that the x and y coordinates never decrease.<br />  Let S(n) be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.  </p><p>  For example, if n = 22, there are 11 distinct stations, and a valid path can pass through at most 5 stations. Therefore, S(22) = 5.  The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:  </p>  <p align=center><img src=project/images/p411_longpath.png></p>  <p>  It can also be verified that S(123) = 14 and S(10000) = 48.  </p><p>  Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> S(k5) for 1 &le; k &le; 30.  </p>
