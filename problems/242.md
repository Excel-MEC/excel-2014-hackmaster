  <p>Given the set {1,2,...,n}, we define f(n,k) as the number of its k-element subsets with an odd sum of elements. For example, f(5,3)&thinsp;=&thinsp;4, since the set {1,2,3,4,5} has four 3-element subsets having an odd sum of elements, i.e.: {1,2,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,4} and {2,4,5}.</p>    <p>When all three values n, k and f(n,k) are odd, we say that they make <br />  an odd-triplet [n,k,f(n,k)].</p>    <p>There are exactly five odd-triplets with n&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;10, namely:<br />  [1,1,f(1,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1], [5,1,f(5,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;3], [5,5,f(5,5)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1], [9,1,f(9,1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;5] and [9,9,f(9,9)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1].</p>    <p>How many odd-triplets are there with n&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;1012&thinsp;?</p>
