  <p>Let's call a lattice point (x, y) inadmissible if x, y and x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y are all positive perfect squares.<br />  For example, (9, 16) is inadmissible, while (0, 4), (3, 1) and (9, 4) are not.</p>    <p>Consider a path from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2) using only unit steps north or east.<br />  Let's call such a path admissible if none of its intermediate points are inadmissible.</p>    <p>Let P(n) be the number of admissible paths from (0, 0) to (n, n).<br />  It can be verified that P(5) = 252, P(16) = 596994440 and P(1000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 341920854.</p>    <p>Find P(10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.</p>
