   <p>By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.</p> <p>For example,</p> <p style='margin-left:50px;font-family:courier new;'>8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2<br /> 14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)<br /> 19 = 4 * (2 + 3) <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1<br /> 36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)</p> <p>Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.</p> <p>Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.</p> <p>Find the set of four distinct digits, a &lt; b &lt c &lt; d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.</p>
