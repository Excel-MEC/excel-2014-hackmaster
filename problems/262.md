  <p>The following equation represents the continuous topography of a mountainous region, giving the elevation h at any point (x,y):</p>      <img src="project/images/p_262_formula1.gif" /><br />      <p>A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving the area given by 0&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;1600.</p>    <p>Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a point A', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same elevation f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly above B.</p>    <p>First, determine fmin which is the minimum constant elevation allowing such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.<br />  Then, find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while flying at that constant elevation fmin.</p>    <p>Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.</p>    <p>Note: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:<br />  h=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp( -abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )</p>
