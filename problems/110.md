  <p>In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.</p>        1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> x   +   1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> y   =   1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> n        <p>It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.</p>  <p>What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?</p>  <p class="info">NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.</p>
