  <p>Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3&times;3&times;n tower with blocks of 2&times;1&times;1. <br />You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.</p>  <p>For example (with q = 100000007) :<br />  f(2) = 229,<br />  f(4) = 117805,<br />  f(10) mod q = 96149360,<br />  f(103) mod q = 24806056,<br />  f(106) mod q = 30808124.</p>    <p>Find f(1010000) mod 100000007.</p>
