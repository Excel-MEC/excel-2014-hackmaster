  <p>We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal's triangle are divisible by 7:</p>      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;2  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;3  &nbsp;  &nbsp;3  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;4  &nbsp;  &nbsp;6  &nbsp;  &nbsp;4  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      &nbsp;  &nbsp;1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;5  &nbsp;  10  &nbsp;  10  &nbsp;  &nbsp;5  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;6  &nbsp;  15  &nbsp;  20  &nbsp;  15  &nbsp;  &nbsp;6  &nbsp;  &nbsp;1      <p>However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of the 5050 entries are not divisible by 7.</p>    <p>Find the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one billion (109) rows of Pascal's triangle.</p>
