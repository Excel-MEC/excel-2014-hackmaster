  <p>Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2&times;1 and 3&times;1 bricks (horizontal&times;vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a &quot;running crack&quot;.</p>    <p>For example, the following 9&times;3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:</p>      <img src="http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_215_crackfree.gif" alt="" />      <p>There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9&times;3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.</p>    <p>Calculate W(32,10).</p>
