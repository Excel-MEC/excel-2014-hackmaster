  Consider the set S(r) of points (x,y) with integer coordinates satisfying |x| + |y| &le; r. <br />  Let O be the point (0,0) and C the point (r/4,r/4). <br />  Let N(r) be the number of points B in S(r), so that the triangle OBC has an obtuse angle, i.e. the largest angle &alpha; satisfies 90&deg;
