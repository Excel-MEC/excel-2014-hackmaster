  <p>All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term of the partition can be expressed as 2ix3j, where i,j <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 0.</p>    <p>Let's consider only those such partitions where none of the terms can divide any of the other terms.  <br>For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (21x30 + 21x31 + 20x32) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (24x30 + 20x30) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (23x30 + 20x32).</br></p>    <p>Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the following two partitions.  <br>11 = 2 + 9 = (21x30 + 20x32)  <br>11 = 8 + 3 = (23x30 + 20x31)</p>    <p>Let's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example, P(11) = 2.</p>    <p>Let's consider only the prime integers q which would have a single valid partition such as P(17).</p>    <p>The sum of the primes q &lt;100 such that P(q)=1 equals 233.</p>    <p>Find the sum of the primes q &lt;1000000 such that P(q)=1.</p>
