  <p>Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.</p>  <p style='text-align:center;font-family:courier new;'>37 36 35 34 33 32 31<br />  38 17 16 15 14 13 30<br />  39 18 &nbsp;5 &nbsp;4 &nbsp;3 12 29<br />  40 19 &nbsp;6 &nbsp;1 &nbsp;2 11 28<br />  41 20 &nbsp;7 &nbsp;8 &nbsp;9 10 27<br />  42 21 22 23 24 25 26<br />  43 44 45 46 47 48 49</p>  <p>It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 <img src='images/symbol_asymp.gif' width='11' height='9' alt='&asymp;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 62%.</p>  <p>If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?</p>
