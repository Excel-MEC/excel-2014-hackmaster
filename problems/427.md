  <p>A sequence of integers S = {si} is called an n-sequence if it has n elements and each element si satisfies 1 &le; si &le; n. Thus there are nn distinct n-sequences in total.  For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.</p>    <p>For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of S with the same value.  For example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.</p>    <p>Let f(n) = <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> L(S) for all n-sequences S.</p>    <p>For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.</p>    <p>Find f(7&nbsp;500&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;009.</p>
