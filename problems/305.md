  <p>  Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10.<br />   Thus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...  </p>  <p>  It's easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of times in S.  </p>  <p>  Let's call f(n) the starting position of the nth occurrence of n in S.<br />   For example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.  </p>  <p>  Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />f(3k) for 1&le;k&le;13.  </p>
