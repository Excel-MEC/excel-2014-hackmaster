  <p>  Let x1, x2,..., xn be a sequence of length n such that:    x1 = 2  for all 1 &lt; i &le; n : xi-1 &lt; xi  for all i and j with 1 &le; i, j &le; n : (xi) j &lt; (xj + 1)i    </p>  <p>  There are only five such sequences of length 2, namely:  {2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.<br />  There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given below:<br />  {2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.  </p>  <p>  Let t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n.<br />  You are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.  </p>  <p>  Find t(1010) and give your answer modulo 109.  </p>
