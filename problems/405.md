  <p>  We wish to tile a rectangle whose length is twice its width.<br />  Let T(0) be the tiling consisting of a single rectangle.<br />  For n > 0, let T(n) be obtained from T(n-1) by replacing all tiles in the following manner:  </p>      <img src="project/images/p_405_tile1.png" />      <p>  The following animation demonstrates the tilings T(n) for n from 0 to 5:  </p>      <img src="project/images/p_405_tile2.gif" />      <p>  Let f(n) be the number of points where four tiles meet in T(n).<br />  For example, f(1) = 0, f(4) = 82 and f(109) mod 177 = 126897180.  </p>    <p>  Find f(10k) for k = 1018, give your answer modulo 177.  </p>
