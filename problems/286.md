  <p>Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1&thinsp;-&nbsp;x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50.</p>    <p>During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, x&thinsp;=&thinsp;2, ..., x&thinsp;=&thinsp;50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2&thinsp;% chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.</p>    <p>Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.</p>
