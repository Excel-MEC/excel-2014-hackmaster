  <p>A composite number can be factored many different ways.    For instance, not including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:</p>    24 = 2x2x2x3<br />  24 = 2x3x4<br />  24 = 2x2x6<br />  24 = 4x6<br />  24 = 3x8<br />  24 = 2x12<br />  24 = 24    <p>Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding together the digits of that number,   and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less than 10.    Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.</p>  <p>We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the individual factors of our number.<br />   The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.</p>    FactorisationDigital Root Sum  2x2x2x3  9  2x3x4  9  2x2x6  10  4x6  10  3x8  11  2x12  5  24  6    <p>The maximum Digital Root Sum  of 24 is 11.<br />  The function mdrs(n) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of n. So  mdrs(24)=11.<br />  Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />mdrs(n) for 1 &lt; n &lt; 1,000,000.</p>
