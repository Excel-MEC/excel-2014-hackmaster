  <p>Build a triangle from all positive integers in the following way:</p>    <p style="font-family:courier new,monospace;font-weight:bold;margin-left:50px;">&nbsp;1<br />  &nbsp;2&nbsp; 3<br />  &nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br />  &nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;9 10<br />  11 12 13 14 15<br />  16 17 18 19 20 21<br />  22 23 24 25 26 27 28<br />  29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36<br />  37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45<br />  46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55<br />  56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66<br />  . . .</p>    <p>Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.</p>    <p>A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.</p>    <p>For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime triplet.</p>    <p>If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.<br />  If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of some prime triplet: 37.</p>    <p>Define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any prime triplet.<br />  Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.</p>    <p>You are given that S(10000)=950007619.</p>    <p>Find &nbsp;S(5678027) + S(7208785).</p>
