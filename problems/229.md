  <p>Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because</p>    3600 = 482 + &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;362<br /><br />  3600 = 202 + 2&times;402<br /><br />  3600 = 302 + 3&times;302<br /><br />  3600 = 452 + 7&times;152<br /><br />      <p>Similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2&times;542 = 2832 + 3&times;522 = 1972 + 7&times;842.</p>    <p>In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.  We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:</p>    n = a12 + &nbsp; b12<br /><br />  n = a22 + 2 b22<br /><br />  n = a32 + 3 b32<br /><br />  n = a72 + 7 b72,    <p>where the ak and bk are positive integers.</p>    <p>There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.<br />    How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2&times;109?</p>
