  <p>  For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.  Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.  </p>  <p>  For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10n with the following properties :    k is divisible by 23 and  d(k) = 23.    </p>  You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.  </p>  <p>  Find S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.  </p>
