  <p>The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a 2N&times;2N  black and white image as a sequence of bits (0 and 1). Those sequences are to be read from left to right like this:  the first bit deals with the complete 2N&times;2N region;  "0" denotes a split:  <br />the current 2n&times;2n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension 2n-1&times;2n-1,<br />  the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;  "10" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;  "11" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.</p>    <p>Consider the following 4&times;4 image (colored marks denote places where a split can occur):</p>  <img src="project/images/p_287_quadtree.gif" />  <p>This image can be described by several sequences, for example :  "001010101001011111011010101010", of length 30, or<br />  "0100101111101110", of length 16, which is the minimal sequence for this image.</p>    <p>For a positive integer N, define DN as the 2N&times;2N image with the following coloring scheme:  the pixel with coordinates x&thinsp;=&thinsp;0, y&thinsp;=&thinsp;0 corresponds to the bottom left pixel,  if (x&thinsp;-&thinsp;2N-1)2&thinsp;+&thinsp;(y&thinsp;-&thinsp;2N-1)2&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;22N-2 then the pixel is black,  otherwise the pixel is white.</p>    <p>What is the length of the minimal sequence describing D24&thinsp;?</p>
