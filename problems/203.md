  <p>The binomial coefficients nCk can be arranged in triangular form, Pascal's triangle, like this:</p>        1  11  121  1331  14641  15101051  1615201561  172135352171    .........      <p>It can be seen that the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle contain twelve distinct numbers: 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;15,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;21&nbsp;and&nbsp;35.</p>    <p>A positive integer n is called squarefree if no square of a prime divides n.  Of the twelve distinct numbers in the first eight rows of Pascal's triangle, all except 4 and 20 are squarefree.  The sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first eight rows is 105.</p>    <p>Find the sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first 51 rows of Pascal's triangle.</p>
