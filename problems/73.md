  <p>Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n&lt;d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.</p>  <p>If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d &le; 8 in ascending order of size, we get:</p>  <p style='text-align:center;font-size:8pt;'>1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8</p>  <p>It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.</p>  <p>How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d &le; 12,000?</p>
