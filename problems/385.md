  <p>  For any triangle T in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside T.  <p align=center>  <img src=project/images/p_385_ellipsetriangle.png></p>  <p>  For a given n, consider triangles T such that:<br />  - the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value &le; n, and <br />  - the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />13,0) and (-<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />13,0).<br />  Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.  </p>  <p>  For example, if n = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72.  </p>  <p>  It can be verified that A(10) = 252, A(100) = 34632 and A(1000) = 3529008.  </p>  <p>  Find A(1 000 000 000).  </p>  <p>    1The foci (plural of focus) of an ellipse are two points A and B such that for every point P on the boundary of the ellipse, AP + PB is constant.      </p>
