  <p>  A definition for an ellipse is:<br />  Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that d(G,M)&lt;r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.  </p>  The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_246_anim.gif" alt="" />    <p>  Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).<br />   Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.<br />  The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.<br />  From a point P outside e the two tangents t1 and t2 to the ellipse are drawn.<br />  Let the points where t1 and t2 touch the ellipse be R and S.  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_246_ellipse.gif" alt="" />  <p>  For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?  </p>
