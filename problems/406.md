  <p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions.   Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br />     "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of a), or   "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of b), or   "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).  </p>    <p>Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.</p>    <p>For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking "2" as our first question.</p>    <p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).<br />  If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be "4".<br />  If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).<br />  If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).<br />  Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.   So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p>    <p>Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.</p>    <p>Here are a few examples:<br />  C(5, 2, 3) = 5<br />  C(500, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />2, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />3) = 13.22073197...<br />  C(20000, 5, 7) = 82<br />  C(2000000, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />5, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />7) = 49.63755955...</p>    <p>Let Fk be the Fibonacci numbers: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1.<br />Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />1&le;k&le;30&nbsp;C(1012, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />k, <img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />Fk), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>
