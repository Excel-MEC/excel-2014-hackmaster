  <p>- A Sierpi&#324;ski graph of order-1 (S1) is an equilateral triangle.<br />  - Sn+1 is obtained from Sn by positioning three copies of Sn so that every pair of copies has one common corner.  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_312_sierpinskyAt.gif" />    <p>Let C(n) be the number of cycles that pass exactly once through all the vertices of Sn.<br />  For example, C(3) = 8 because eight such cycles can be drawn on S3, as shown below:  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_312_sierpinsky8t.gif" />    <p>It can also be verified that :<br />  C(1) = C(2) = 1<br />  C(5) = 71328803586048<br />  C(10 000) mod 108 = 37652224<br />  C(10 000) mod 138 = 617720485<br />  </p>    <p>Find C(C(C(10 000))) mod 138.  </p>
