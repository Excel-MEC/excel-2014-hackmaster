  <p>It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.</p>  <p>We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.</p>  <p>Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).</p>
