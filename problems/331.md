  <p>N&times;N disks are placed on a square game board. Each disk has a black side and white side.</p>    <p>At each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same row and the same column as this disk: thus 2&times;N-1 disks are flipped. The game ends when all disks show their white side. The following example shows a game on a 5&times;5 board.</p>    <img src="project/images/p_331_crossflips3.gif" />    <p>It can be proven that 3 is the minimal number of turns to finish this game.</p>    <p>The bottom left disk on the N&times;N board has coordinates (0,0);<br />  the bottom right disk has coordinates (N-1,0) and the top left disk has coordinates (0,N-1). </p>    <p>Let CN be the following configuration of a board with N&times;N disks:<br />  A disk at (x,y) satisfying <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_331_crossflips1.gif" />, shows its black side; otherwise, it shows its white side. C5 is shown above.</p>    <p>Let T(N) be the minimal number of turns to finish a game starting from configuration CN or 0 if configuration CN is unsolvable.<br />  We have shown that T(5)=3. You are also given that T(10)=29 and T(1 000)=395253.</p>    <p>Find <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_331_crossflips2.gif" />.</p>
