  <p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.</p>              0 0 3<br />9 0 0<br />0 0 1  0 2 0<br />3 0 5<br />8 0 6  6 0 0<br />0 0 1<br />4 0 0      0 0 8<br />7 0 0<br />0 0 6  1 0 2<br />0 0 0<br />7 0 8  9 0 0<br />0 0 8<br />2 0 0      0 0 2<br />8 0 0<br />0 0 5  6 0 9<br />2 0 3<br />0 1 0  5 0 0<br />0 0 9<br />3 0 0        <img src='images/spacer.gif' width='50' height='1' alt='' /><br />        4 8 3<br />9 6 7<br />2 5 1  9 2 1<br />3 4 5<br />8 7 6  6 5 7<br />8 2 1<br />4 9 3      5 4 8<br />7 2 9<br />1 3 6  1 3 2<br />5 6 4<br />7 9 8  9 7 6<br />1 3 8<br />2 4 5      3 7 2<br />8 1 4<br />6 9 5  6 8 9<br />2 5 3<br />4 1 7  5 1 4<br />7 6 9<br />3 8 2                <p>A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ &quot;guess and test&quot; methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.</p>  <p>The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).</p>  <p>By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.</p>
