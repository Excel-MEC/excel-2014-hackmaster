  <p>  Given two points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) in three dimensional space, the Manhattan distance  between those points is defined as <br /> |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|+|z1-z2|.  </p>  <p>  Let C(r) be a sphere with radius r and center in the origin O(0,0,0).<br />  Let I(r) be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the surface of C(r).<br />  Let S(r) be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of I(r) to the origin O.  </p>  <p>  E.g. S(45)=34518.  </p>  <p>  Find S(1010).  </p>
