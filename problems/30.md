   <p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:</p> 1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44<br /> 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84<br /> 9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44 <p class='info'>As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.</p> <p>The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.</p> <p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.</p>
