  <p>It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.</p>  <p style='margin-left:10px;'>9 = 7 + 2&times;12<br />  15 = 7 + 2&times;22<br />  21 = 3 + 2&times;32<br />  25 = 7 + 2&times;32<br />  27 = 19 + 2&times;22<br />  33 = 31 + 2&times;12</p>  <p>It turns out that the conjecture was false.</p>  <p>What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?</p>
