  <p>  Define Co(n) to be the maximal possible sum of a set of mutually co-prime elements from {1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;n}.<br /> For example Co(10) is 30 and hits that maximum on the subset {1,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;9}.  </p>    <p>  You are given that Co(30) = 193 and Co(100) = 1356.   </p>    <p>Find Co(200000).  </p>
