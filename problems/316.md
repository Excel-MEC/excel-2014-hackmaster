  <p>Let p = p1 p2 p3 ... be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.<br />  It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p1 p2 p3 .... <br />  It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval [0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.</p>    <p>For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest index such that <br /> pk, pk+1, ...pk+d-1 are the decimal digits of n, in the same order.<br />  Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.</p>    <p>For example, if n = 535, then<br />  for p = 31415926535897...., we get k = 9<br />  for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354..., we get k = 36<br />  etc and we find that g(535) = 1008.</p>    <p>Given that <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_316_decexp1.gif" />, find <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_316_decexp2.gif" /></p>    Note: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_316_decexp3.gif" /> represents the floor function.
