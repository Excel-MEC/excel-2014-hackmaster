  <p>  For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3, ...} is defined as:     g1 = n   for k <img src='images/symbol_gt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&gt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1, gk is obtained by writing gk-1 in base k, interpreting it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.    The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.  </p>  <p>  For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:     g1 = 6.   g2 = 11 since 6 = 1102, 1103 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.   g3 = 17 since 11 = 1023, 1024 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.   g4 = 25 since 17 = 1014, 1015 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.    and so on.  </p>  <p>  It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.  </p>  <p>  Let G(n) be the number of nonzero elements in the nth weak Goodstein sequence.<br />  It can be verified that G(2) = 3, G(4) = 21 and G(6) = 381.<br />  It can also be verified that &Sigma;G(n) = 2517 for 1 &le; n &lt; 8.  </p>  <p>  Find the last 9 digits of &Sigma;G(n) for 1 &le; n &lt; 16.  </p>
