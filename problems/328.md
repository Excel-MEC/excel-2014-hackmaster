  <p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions.   Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:<br />     "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or   "Yes, that's it!", or   "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".  </p>    <p>Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.</p>    <p>If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).</p>    <p>If n=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our first question would be "4" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.<br />  Let our second question be "6". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.<br />  Thus, our third question will be "7" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.</p>    <p>We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking "5" as our first question.<br />  If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be "7", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).<br />  If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be "3" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be "1", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.<br />  Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.<br />  So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.</p>    <p>Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as described above.<br />  Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.<br />  Similarly, C(100) = 400 and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_328_sum1.gif" />C(n) = 17575.</p>    <p>Find <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_328_sum2.gif" />C(n).</p>
