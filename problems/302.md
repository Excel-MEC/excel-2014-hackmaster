  <p>  A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime factor p in n.  </p>  <p>  A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power of another positive integer.  </p>  <p>  A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 = 25&middot;33 and 1800 = 23&middot;32&middot;52.  </p>  <p>  We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and &phi;(S) are Achilles numbers.1<br />  For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: &phi;(864) = 288 = 25&middot;32. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: &phi;(1800) = 480 = 25&middot;31&middot;51.  </p>  <p>There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 104 and 656 below 108.  </p>  <p>  How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 1018?  </p>  <p>  1 &phi; denotes Euler's totient function.  </p>
