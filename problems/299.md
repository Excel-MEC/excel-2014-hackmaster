  <p>Four points with integer coordinates are selected:<br />A(a,&nbsp;0), B(b,&nbsp;0), C(0,&nbsp;c) and D(0,&nbsp;d),   with 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;b and 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;c&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;d.<br />  Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.</p>  <img src="project/images/p_299_ThreeSimTri.gif" />  <p>It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.</p>    <p>So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.</p>    <p>For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1) satisfies the above condition.   Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.</p>    <p>If b+d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists.<br />  If b+d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists.</p>  <p>If b+d&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such that point P exists?</p>
