  <p>Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.</p>        OOOOO      OOOO&nbsp; &nbsp;O      OOO&nbsp; &nbsp;OO      OOO&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O      OO&nbsp; &nbsp;OO&nbsp; &nbsp;O      OO&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O      O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp;O        <p>Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.</p>
