  <p>There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.</p>  <p>For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82&times;19 = 123.</p>  <p>What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.</p>  <p>How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?</p>
