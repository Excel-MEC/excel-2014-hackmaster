  <p>  Ea is an ellipse with an equation of the form x2 + 4y2 = 4a2.<br />  Ea' is the rotated image of Ea by &theta; degrees counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0&deg; &lt; &theta; &lt; 90&deg;.  </p>      <img src="project/images/p_404_c_ellipse.gif" />      <p>  b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection points.<br />  We call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a canonical ellipsoidal triplet if a, b and c are positive integers.<br />  For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.  </p>    <p>  Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b, c) for a &le; N.<br />  It can be verified that C(103) = 7, C(104) = 106 and C(106) = 11845.  </p>    <p>  Find C(1017).  </p>
