  <p>Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:</p>  <p style='text-align:center;'>x2 &ndash; Dy2 = 1</p>  <p>For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 &ndash; 13&times;1802 = 1.</p>  <p>It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.</p>  <p>By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:</p>  <p style='margin-left:20px;'>32 &ndash; 2&times;22 = 1<br />  22 &ndash; 3&times;12 = 1<br />  92 &ndash; 5&times;42 = 1<br />  52 &ndash; 6&times;22 = 1<br />  82 &ndash; 7&times;32 = 1</p>  <p>Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D &le; 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.</p>  <p>Find the value of D &le; 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.</p>
