  <p>  Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 &le; a,b,c &le; N.  </p>  <p>  From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.<br />  Let D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.  </p>  <p>  You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.  </p><p>  Find D(1010). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.  </p>
