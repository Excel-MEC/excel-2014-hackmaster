  <p>If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>  <p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, <br />un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...</p>  <p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that &quot;simple is best&quot; we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>  <p>We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n &le; k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).</p>  <p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 2, OP(1, n) = u1.</p>  <p>Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:</p>        OP(1, n) = 1  1, 1, 1, 1, ...      OP(2, n) = 7n<img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />6  1, 8, 15, ...      OP(3, n) = 6n2<img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />11n+6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  1, 8, 27, 58, ...      OP(4, n) = n3  1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...        <p>Clearly no BOPs exist for k <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 4.</p>  <p>By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.</p>  <p>Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:</p>  <p style='text-align:center;'>un = 1 <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n + n2 <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n3 + n4 <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n5 + n6 <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n7 + n8 <img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n9 + n10</p>  <p>Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>
