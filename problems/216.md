  <p>Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n <img src='images/symbol_gt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&gt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1.<br />  The first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.<br />  It turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.<br />  For n &le; 10000 there are 2202 numbers t(n)  that are prime.</p>    <p>How many numbers t(n) are prime for n &le; 50,000,000 ?</p>
