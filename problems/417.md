  <p>A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:</p>        1/2=&nbsp;0.5      1/3=&nbsp;0.(3)      1/4=&nbsp;0.25      1/5=&nbsp;0.2      1/6=&nbsp;0.1(6)      1/7=&nbsp;0.(142857)      1/8=&nbsp;0.125      1/9=&nbsp;0.(1)      1/10=&nbsp;0.1        <p>Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.</p>  <p>  Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.<br />  We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0.   </p>  <p>  Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.  You are given that <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />L(n) for 3 &le; n &le; 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.  </p>  <p>  Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />L(n) for 3 &le; n &le; 100 000 000
