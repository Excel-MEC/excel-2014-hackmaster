  <p>We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the following properties:<br />    there are at least three vertices,  no three vertices are aligned,  each vertex has integer coordinates,  each edge has integer length.</p>      <p>For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is &le;&thinsp;n.<br />  Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.</p>    <p>You are given that P(4)&thinsp;=&thinsp;1, P(30)&thinsp;=&thinsp;3655 and P(60)&thinsp;=&thinsp;891045.<br />  Find P(120).</p>
