  A cubic B&eacute;zier curve is defined by four points: P0, P1, P2 and P3.</P>  <p>    The curve is constructed as follows:<br>  On the segments P0P1, P1P2 and P2P3 the points Q0,Q1 and Q2 are drawn such that  P0Q0/P0P1=P1Q1/P1P2=P2Q2/P2P3=t (t in [0,1]).<br>  On the segments Q0Q1 and Q1Q2 the points R0 and R1 are drawn such that  Q0R0/Q0Q1=Q1R1/Q1Q2=t for the same value of t.<br>  On the segment R0R1 the point B is drawn such that R0B/R0R1=t for the same value of t.</BR>  The B&eacute;zier curve defined by the points P0, P1, P2, P3 is the locus of B as Q0 takes all possible positions on the segment P0P1. (Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.)   <br>  </p>  <p>                   </p>    <p>  In the applet to the right you can drag the points P0, P1, P2 and P3 to see what the B&eacute;zier curve (green curve) defined by those points  looks like. You can also drag the point Q0 along the segment P0P1.  </p>  <p>  From the construction it is clear that the B&eacute;zier curve will be tangent to the segments P0P1 in P0 and P2P3 in P3.  </p>  <p>  <br />  <br />  <br />  </p>  <p>  A cubic B&eacute;zier curve with P0=(1,0), P1=(1,v), P2=(v,1) and P3=(0,1) is used to approximate a quarter circle.<br />  The value v<img src='images/symbol_gt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&gt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines OP0, OP3 and the curve is equal to &pi;/4 (the area of the quarter circle).  </p>  <p>  By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the quarter circle?<br />  That is, if L is the length of the curve, calculate  100*(L-&pi;/2)/(&pi;/2).<br />  Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
