  <p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>  <p>Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.</p>    <img src="project/images/p_173_square_laminas.gif" alt="" />    <p>If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type L(1) and t = 32 is type L(2).</p>  <p>Let N(n) be the number of t &le; 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for example, N(15) = 832.</p>  <p>What is <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> N(n) for 1 &le; n &le; 10?</p>
