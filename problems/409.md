  <p>Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where:  There are n non-empty piles.  Each pile has size less than 2n.  No two piles have the same size.  </p>  <p>Let W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above  conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007 = 384777056.  </p>  <p>Find W(10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;007.  </p>
