  <p>  A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet if it satisfies the condition:</p>    <img src="project/images/p_251_cardano.gif" alt="" />  <p>  For example, (2,1,5) is a Cardano Triplet.  </p>  <p>  There exist 149 Cardano Triplets for which a+b+c &le; 1000.  </p>  <p>  Find how many Cardano Triplets exist such that a+b+c &le; 110,000,000.
