  <p>2N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.</p>    <p>For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:</p>  <img src="project/images/p_265_BinaryCircles.gif" />    <p>For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:<br /> 000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.</p>    <p>Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3 are thus represented as 23 and 29:  00010111&thinsp;2 = 23  00011101&thinsp;2 = 29</p>    <p>Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.</p>    <p>Find S(5).</p>
