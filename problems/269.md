  <p>A root or zero of a polynomial P(x) is a solution to the equation P(x) = 0. <br/>  Define Pn as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of n.<br/>  For example, P5703(x) = 5x3 + 7x2 + 3.</p>    <p>We can see that:  Pn(0) is the last digit of n,  Pn(1) is the sum of the digits of n,  Pn(10) is n itself.</p>    <p>Define Z(k) as the number of positive integers, n, not exceeding k for which the polynomial Pn has at least one integer root.</p>    <p>It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.</p>    <p>What is Z(1016)?</p>
