  <p>Let Sm = (x1, x2, ... , xm) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers with x1 + x2 + ... + xm = m for which Pm = x1 * x22 * ... * xmm is maximised.</p>    <p>For example, it can be verified that [P10] = 4112 ([ ] is the integer part function).</p>    <p>Find &Sigma;[Pm] for 2 &le; m &le; 15.</p>
