  <p>Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.</p>    <p>Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.<br/>  For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:</p>  <p>22852 + 203<br/>  22232 + 663<br/>  18102 + 1253<br/>  11972 + 1563</p>     <p>Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.</p>
