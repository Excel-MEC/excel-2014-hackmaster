  <p>The Thue-Morse sequence {Tn} is a binary sequence satisfying:</p>    T0 = 0  T2n = Tn  T2n+1 = 1 - Tn    <p>  The first several terms of {Tn} are given as follows:<br />  01101001100101101001011001101001....  </p>    <p>  We define {An} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {Tn}.<br />  For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010 appears in {Tn} (T8 to T12), so 18 is an element of {An}.<br />  The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never appears in {Tn}, so 14 is not an element of {An}.  </p>    <p>  The first several terms of An are given as follows:<br />      n0123456789101112&hellip;  An012345691011121318&hellip;  </p>    <p>  We can also verify that A100 = 3251 and A1000 = 80852364498.  </p>    <p>  Find the last 9 digits of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_361_Thue-Morse1.gif" />.  </p>
