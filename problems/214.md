  <p>Let &phi; be Euler's totient function, i.e. for a natural number n,  &phi;(n) is the number of k, 1 &le; k &le; n, for which gcd(k,n) = 1.</p>    <p>By iterating &phi;, each positive integer generates a decreasing chain of numbers ending in 1.<br />  E.g. if we start with 5 the sequence 5,4,2,1 is generated.<br />  Here is a listing of all chains with length 4:</p>      5,4,2,1<br />  7,6,2,1<br />  8,4,2,1<br />  9,6,2,1<br />  10,4,2,1<br />  12,4,2,1<br />  14,6,2,1<br />  18,6,2,1    <p>Only two of these chains start with a prime, their sum is 12.</p>    <p>What is the sum of all primes less than 40000000 which generate a chain of length 25?</p>
