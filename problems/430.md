  <p>N disks are placed in a row, indexed 1 to N from left to right.<br>  Each disk has a black side and white side. Initially all disks show their white side.</p>    <p>At each turn, two, not necessarily distinct, integers A and B between 1 and N (inclusive) are chosen uniformly at random.<br>  All disks with an index from A to B (inclusive) are flipped.</p>    <p>The following example shows the case N = 8. At the first turn A = 5 and B = 2, and at the second turn A = 4 and B = 6.</p>    <p align=center><img src="project/images/p_430_flips.gif" /></p>    <p>Let E(N, M) be the expected number of disks that show their white side after M turns.<br>  We can verify that E(3, 1) = 10/9, E(3, 2) = 5/3, E(10, 4) <img src='images/symbol_asymp.gif' width='11' height='9' alt='&asymp;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 5.157 and E(100, 10) <img src='images/symbol_asymp.gif' width='11' height='9' alt='&asymp;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 51.893.</p>    <p>Find E(1010, 4000).<br>  Give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>
