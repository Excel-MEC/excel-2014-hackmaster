        <h2>Seriously, what the f**k else do you want?</h2>
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherf**ker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherf**ker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your f**king point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
